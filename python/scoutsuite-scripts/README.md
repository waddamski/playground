# ScoutSuite Summary Script

The ScoutSuite Results Summary Script takes json files generated by ScoutSuite, parses them 
and returns a more manageable amount of pertinent information

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3.   
You also need to have run a ScoutSuite scan and be able to download the json files for the flagged
issues.


### Usage

Run as follows:   

```python3 scout_results_summary.py <path_to_json_file> <aws_profile>```

aws_profile needs to be the profile specified in your ~/.aws/config file that relates to the 
environment that you ran the ScoutSuite scan against.
So if you ran ScoutSuite against prod, and your profile is 'ds-prod' then this is how you'd run it:

```python3 scout_results_summary.py iam-managed-policy-allows-iam-PassRole.json ds-prod```

### To do

Going forwards I'd like to do the following:
* Add recognition for more issues from ScoutSuite.
* Change the functions to provide more utility based on experience.
* Change the structure to make use of classes.
